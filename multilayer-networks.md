### Abstract
> A scenario has recently been reported in which in order to stabilize complete synchronization of an oscillator network---a symmetric state---the symmetry of the system itself has to be broken by making the oscillators nonidentical.
> But how often does such behavior---which we term asymmetry-induced synchronization (_AISync_)---occur in oscillator networks?
> Here we present the first general scheme for constructing _AISync_ systems and demonstrate that this behavior is the norm rather than the exception in a wide class of physical systems that can be seen as multilayer networks.
> Since a symmetric network in complete synchrony is the basic building block of cluster synchronization in more general networks, _AISync_ should be common also in facilitating cluster synchronization by breaking the symmetry of the cluster subnetworks.
