### Synopsis
Basins of attraction are fundamental to the analysis of many physical systems such as spin glasses, neural networks, and power grids, where multiple attractors compete for the available state space. Despite their foundational importance, there is still a lot to be learned about the sizes and shapes of basins in systems with many degrees of freedom. In our Letter, we make a key advance in this area by showing that the geometry of basins is often octopus-like, with long tentacles that meander far and wide in state space. Interestingly, nearly all the basin volume is concentrated in these tentacles. Our study is likely to stimulate further explorations of basins in high-dimensional systems, with potential applications ranging from understanding machine learning to optimizing complex interconnected systems such as power grids.
