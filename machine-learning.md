### Time-series foundation models
Can pre-trained transformers forecast a chaotic system without being trained on the same system?

### Reservior computing
Reservoir Computing (RC) is a simple and efficient model-free framework for forecasting the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems from data. I am interested in understanding the success as well as identifying limitations of RC.

### Causal inference
Can we infer causal hypergraphs from time-series data in a model-free fashion? How important are higher-order interactions in the brain?

### Dynamic modes decomposition
Can DMD automatically identify glassy dynamics (e.g., algebraic relaxation) from high-dimensional data?

### Reinforcement learning
Can we use reinforcement learning (RL) to improve synchronization? Would the solutions found by RL be interpretable?
