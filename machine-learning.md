### Reservior computing
Reservoir Computing (RC) is a simple and efficient model-free framework for forecasting the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems from data. I am interested in understanding the success as well as identifying limitations of RC.

### Reinforcement learning
Can we use reinforcement learning (RL) to improve synchronization? Would the solutions found by RL be interpretable?
