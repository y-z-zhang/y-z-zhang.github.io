### Higher-order interactions
Do higher-order interactions promote synchronization? Which higher-order representation should we choose when modeling systems with nonpairwise interactions?

### Temporal networks
Do temporal networks have a fundamental advantage over static networks? Can time-varying connections be used as a control mechanism?
