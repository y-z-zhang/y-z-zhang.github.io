### Dynamics on hypergraphs
Do higher-order interactions promote synchronization? Should we use hypergraphs or simplicial complexes when modeling systems with higher-order interactions?
* __Y. Zhang__\*, M. Lucas\*, and F. Battiston, *Higher-order interactions shape collective dynamics differently in hypergraphs and simplicial complexes*, [Nat. Commun. 14, 1605 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37190-9)

Can higher-order interactions affect linear stability and basin stability differently?
* __Y. Zhang__, P. S. Skardal, F. Battiston, G. Petri, and M. Lucas, *Deeper but smaller: Higher-order interactions increase linear stability but shrink basins*, [Sci. Adv. 10, ado8049 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ado8049)

### Hypergraphs from dynamics
Can we infer causal hypergraphs from time-series data in a model-free fashion? How important are higher-order interactions in the brain?

### Temporal networks
How to do stability analysis of cluster synchronization states on generalized networks?
* __Y. Zhang__, V. Latora, and A. E. Motter, *Unified treatment of synchronization patterns in generalized networks with higher-order, multilayer, and temporal interactions*, [Commun. Phys. 4, 195 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-021-00695-0)

Do temporal networks have a fundamental advantage over static networks? Can time-varying connections be used as a control mechanism?
* __Y. Zhang__ and S. H. Strogatz, *Designing temporal networks that synchronize under resource constraints*, [Nat. Commun. 12, 3273 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23446-9)
