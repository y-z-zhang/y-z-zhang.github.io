### Hypergraphs and simplicial complexes
Do higher-order interactions promote synchronization? Should we use hypergraphs or simplicial complexes when modeling systems with higher-order interactions?
* __Y. Zhang__\*, M. Lucas\*, and F. Battiston, *Higher-order interactions shape collective dynamics differently in hypergraphs and simplicial complexes*, [Nat. Commun. 14, 1605 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37190-9)

How to do stability analysis of cluster synchronization states on hypergraphs?
* __Y. Zhang__, V. Latora, and A. E. Motter, *Unified treatment of synchronization patterns in generalized networks with higher-order, multilayer, and temporal interactions*, [Commun. Phys. 4, 195 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-021-00695-0)

Can we infer the underlying hypergraphs from time-series data in a model-free fashion? How important are higher-order interactions in the brain?
* R. Delabays, G. De Pasquale, F. DÃ¶rfler, and **Y. Zhang**, *Hypergraph reconstruction from dynamics*, [arXiv:2402.00078](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00078)

Can higher-order interactions affect linear stability and basin stability differently?
* __Y. Zhang__, P. S. Skardal, F. Battiston, G. Petri, and M. Lucas, *Deeper but smaller: Higher-order interactions increase linear stability but shrink basins*, [arXiv:2309.16581](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16581)

### Temporal networks
Do temporal networks have a fundamental advantage over static networks? Can time-varying connections be used as a control mechanism?
* __Y. Zhang__ and S. H. Strogatz, *Designing temporal networks that synchronize under resource constraints*, [Nat. Commun. 12, 3273 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23446-9)
