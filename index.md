I am a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org) at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu), working with [Steven Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com). I got my Ph.D. in Physics from Northwestern, advised by [Adilson Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/). I also have fond memories working at Cornell and at IBM Research. You can reach me at <yzhang@santafe.edu>.

My interest lies at the interface of networks and nonlinear dynamics. When microscopic entities interact, they can often coordinate with each other and achieve a macroscopic impact. Think of electrons dancing together to create superconductivity, cardiac pacemakers beating synchronously to generate rhythmic impulses, and birds flocking together to confuse predators. From quantum networks to circadian clocks, we have much to learn when it comes to the relations between a network's structure, dynamics, and function. I draw techniques from dynamical systems, graph theory, and statistical mechanics to help uncover the simplicity hidden in complex systems. Some topics I worked on recently include the effect of disorder in networked dynamical systems, understanding chimera states as cluster synchronization patterns, collective dynamics on models beyond standard networks, and basins of attraction in high-dimensional systems.
