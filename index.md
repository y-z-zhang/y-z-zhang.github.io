I am an [Omidyar Fellow](https://www.santafe.edu/research/fellowships/omidyar) at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu). Before that, I was a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org) at Cornell working with [Steven Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com). I got my Ph.D. in Physics from Northwestern in 2020, advised by [Adilson Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/). You can reach me at <yzhang@santafe.edu>.

I am interested in developing mathematical and computational tools for the study of complex systems, especially using techniques from dynamical systems, network theory, and machine learning. I apply these tools to understand the behavior of complex systems that are often nonlinear and high-dimensional, which includes questions in mathematical biology (how do circadian clocks re-synchronize as we recover from jet lag?), neuroscience (how important are nonpairwise interactions in shaping macroscopic brain dynamics?), and data-driven modeling (is zero-shot forecasting of chaotic systems possible?). Some topics I worked on recently include high-dimensional basins in multistable systems, dynamics on higher-order networks, and out-of-distribution generalization in neural networks.
