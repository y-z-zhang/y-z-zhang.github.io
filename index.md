I am an [Omidyar Fellow](https://www.santafe.edu/research/fellowships/omidyar) at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu). Before that, I was a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org) at Cornell working with [Steven Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com). I got my Ph.D. in Physics from Northwestern in 2020, advised by [Adilson Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/). You can reach me at <yzhang@santafe.edu>.

My interest lies at the interface of networks and nonlinear dynamics. In my research, I draw techniques from dynamical systems, graph theory, and machine learning to help elucidate how order emerges from chaos in coupled systems. Some topics I worked on recently include the effect of disorder on network dynamics, topological control of dynamical patterns (cluster synchronization and chimera states), networks with nonpairwise interactions, basins of attraction in high-dimensional systems, and learning unknown dynamical systems from data.

<!-- When microscopic entities interact, they can often coordinate with each other and achieve a macroscopic impact. -->

<!-- the simplicity hidden in these complex systems -->

<!-- Think of electrons dancing together to create superconductivity, cardiac pacemakers beating synchronously to generate rhythmic impulses, and birds flocking together to confuse predators. -->

<!-- What gives rise to the emergence of collective dynamics in these coupled many-body systems, especially when the interactions are non-local, irregular, and multifaceted? -->

<!-- By combining advanced mathematical tools with experimental data, my work contributes to a deeper understanding of the relations between a network's structure, dynamics, and function. -->
