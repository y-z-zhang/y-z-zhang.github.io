I am a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org) at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu), working with [Steven Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com). I got my Ph.D. in Physics from Northwestern, advised by [Adilson Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/). I also have fond memories working at Cornell and IBM Research. You can reach me at <yzhang@santafe.edu>.

My interest lies at the interface of networks and nonlinear dynamics. When microscopic entities interact, they can often coordinate with each other and achieve a macroscopic impact. Think of electrons dancing together to create superconductivity, cardiac pacemakers beating synchronously to generate rhythmic impulses, and birds flocking together to confuse predators. I draw techniques from dynamical systems, graph theory, and statistical mechanics to help uncover the simplicity hidden in these complex systems. Some topics I worked on recently include the effect of disorder in networked dynamical systems, topological control of network dynamics, coexistence of coherence and incoherence in systems with symmetries, cluster synchronization on models beyond standard networks, and basins of attraction in high-dimensional systems. By combining advanced mathematical tools with experimental data, my work contributes to a deeper understanding of the relations between a network's structure, dynamics, and function.
