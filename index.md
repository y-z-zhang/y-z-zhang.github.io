I am an [Omidyar Fellow](https://www.santafe.edu/research/fellowships/omidyar) at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu). Before that, I was a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org) at Cornell working with [Steven Strogatz](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com). I got my Ph.D. in Physics from Northwestern in 2020, advised by [Adilson Motter](http://dyn.phys.northwestern.edu/). You can reach me at <yzhang@santafe.edu>.

My interest lies at the interface of networks and nonlinear dynamics. In my research, I draw techniques from dynamical systems, graph theory, and machine learning to understand the behavior of highly nonlinear and high-dimensional systems. Some topics I worked on recently include the collective dynamics on hypergraphs and simplicial complexes, basins of attraction in rugged energy landscapes, and data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.
