### Order out of disorder
Despite the common belief that individual differences are detrimental to uniform group dynamics, the opposite can be true and, in fact, quite common. One theme of my research is to understand when and why uniformity can grow out of diversity in coupled systems.

### Cluster synchronization
Complex networks often support complex synchronization patterns. Understanding such patterns will enable us to manipulate the behavior of numerous biological, social, and technological systems. I work on general theories and efficient algorithms to identify, characterize, and control synchronization patterns in both standard and generalized networks.

### Chimera states
One particularly interesting type of synchronization patterns is chimera states, where a network of identically coupled identical oscillators spontaneously splits into coherent and incoherent clusters. It represents symmetry breaking phenomena in networks. I contribute to the understanding of chimera states by characterizing new chimeras and proposing general mechanisms giving rise to such states.

### Applications
Many real-world systems can be modelled as coupled oscillators. I work with domain experts to advance our understanding of systems such as circadian clocks and pancreatic islets.
